# Complex-Data-Management

### This repository contains exercises for the course of Complex Data Management. 

- The first exercise aims to develop programs for the evaluation of conjunction, union, intersection, difference, and aggregation operators on synthetic data. More on this here: [assignment](ex1/Assignment1.pdf)
and see the report here: [report](ex1/Report.pdf)

- The second exercise aims to construct and use an R-tree index for spatial data. We build an R-Tree with Bulk Loading. We then implement a function to evaluate range queries in the R-Tree that we built **(Range queries)**. Last but not least we implement the best-first search algorithm to retrieve the closest MBR object to a reference point q **(kNN queries)**
